# Deep-Secure
Intelligent Surveillance System

# Introduction 
In our modern world, living in cities has become essential for our lives, cities do provide
us with the essentials of life that we need as nutrition, transportation and many other
things that guarantee a good life for us, but the most important feature is safety, safety is
one of the main concerns for every family and every resident in general, in addition to
the current security system, we introduce our intelligent surveillance system "Deep
Secure" which facilitates the emergency management process as it provides
instantaneous reports for different emergent situations such as road accidents, fires,
violence so that it gives accurate report for the current situation and reports to the
competent authorities.

# Illustration of the usage scenario
The system would be installed on surveillance cameras distributed in specific regions.
Deep Secure will get his data based on the current camera footage.
System will process the current data, it will only be triggered if it did detect one of the
listed down below actions:
- Building Fires
- Road Accidents
- Violence
- Passerby critical health problems as fainting (In Progress)

Once triggered it would send printed report to the convenient department as fire,
medical or police departments containing emergent description and the precise
location including a sample photo from the incident scene.
